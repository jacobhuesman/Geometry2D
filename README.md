# Geometry2D
A Julia language geometry toobox for 2D geometric computing.

Geometry2D is a library for geometric computing with Julia. The goal is to replicate, as closely as possible, the functionality and methodology of the [mattools/matGeom/geom2d](https://github.com/mattools/matGeom) project, while taking advantage of the Julia language (multiple dispatch, etc).  That is, to allow for the processing and display of geometric planar shapes such as point sets, edges, straight lines, bounding boxes, and conics (circles and ellipses).

The toolbox is a work in progress.
